                          <p>Career Counseling is a process that will help you to know and understand yourself and the world of work in order to make career, educational and life decisions. Selecting the right career is very important as your career defines your true individual self, the kind of lifestyle one has and the people one likes to interacts with. In short, one's career has an impact on the quality of one's life. Applying for higher education abroad is a critical decision, both financially and emotionally. Therefore, it is mandatory to invest adequate time and effort in order to make the right career decision. .</p>

                          <h4>Most Importantly We Do Not Make Any False Promises, 'What We Promise, We Deliver'</h4>
                          <p>To assist students to select a career scientifically, vmv immigiration has created the Academic Pathway Planning Program.</p>

                          <h5>Academic Pathway Planning</h5>
                          <p>The world is filled with various career choices ranging from medicine to mass communication, engineering to event management, marine biology to information technology. To select the right career from the various options available today, has become a daunting and challenging process. A large number of students continue to choose a career based merely on the fact that their friends are doing the same thing or because their parents told them to do so. This, however, may not be the best way to go about it. We at vmv immigiration understand the dilemma of the students while choosing the pathways for higher education. To cater to such needs vmv consultanncy conducts a vocational guidance program called Academic Pathway Planning.</p>
                          <strong>Academic Pathway Planning Involves Assessment In 3 Areas:</strong>
                          <li><strong>Aptitude: </strong>We assess different abilities which helps identify fields one will excel in</li>
                          <li><strong>Interest: </strong>Helps us identify the kind of activities and work one would like to do</li>
                          <li><strong>Personality: </strong> It involves multidimensional personality assessment that helps understand who one truly is, one's character traits, qualities and shortcomings.</li>
