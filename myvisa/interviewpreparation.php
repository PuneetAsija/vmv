                            <p>We prepare our clients according to their requirements which they seek to fulfill in the course of deciding a right career path for them. The interview is the most important section and can be a deal breaker in many cases. A great deal is at stake if one doesn't prepare well for the interview.

Knowing 'what to say' 'when to say ‘and 'how to say' can be major determinants leading your final result. A good personality and project knowledge doesn't only help one reach great heights in terms of their respective career but also helps one grow and enhance one as a successful individual.</p>
                            <p>The biggest mistake one makes while going for an interview is not being fully prepared. It is important to understand and acknowledge the fact that one needs to prepare for interviews. There is very thin line between being prepared and being over-confident. A person who can understand this minute difference is the one who can ace any interview. Being interviewed can be nerve shaking and also could give you cold feet but only when you're not well prepared. Your journey from Aspiring to be able to see yourself being a part of your dream college or profession to seeing yourself hitting the targets can be determined on the days and efforts you put into making your interview look like a cake walk. Initial preparation requires assessment of skills, interests, values, and accomplishments; a re-assessment and updating of one's resume; and research on the targeted University . Preparation also includes actual practice of typical and targeted interview questions. Final preparation includes details of dress and appearance, knowledge of the location of the interview, what to expect, and protocols for follow-up</p>

                            <h4>There are two basic question formats: directive and open-ended.</h4>
                            <p>Directive questions typically verify or clarify information. Most of these questions can be answered in 1-2 sentences. Open-ended questions are used to expand previous answers, and take more time.</p>

                            <h4>Students Related Interview Preparation:</h4>
                            <p>Interviews conducted by various Institutes abroad are very rare and are usually limited to some business schools.

Some schools conduct interviews telephonically and some others through their alumni who are based in the city you live in. If you happen to be applying to an institute that wants to interview, you must to be prepared.</p>

                            <h6>Other typical interview questions would most likely be from one of these categories:</h6>

                            <p>2) Why do you want to attend this school?</p>
                            <p>3) Name some other schools that you have applied to?</p>
                            <p>4) Tell me about yourself.</p>
                            <p>5) What are your career goals?</p>
                            <p>6) Where do you see yourself in ten years?</p>
                            <p>7) What value can you add to the program?</p>
                            <p>8) What are your greatest achievements?</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>a) <strong> Undergraduate Education :</strong> Remember your interviewers are from the academia, so give adequate importance to learning and education. Show your commitment towards learning and growing. Talk about your extracurricular activities and how these activities have helped you grow holistically. Focus and put extra emphasis on your contribution as well as what you have learnt. Describe how your schooling had helped you in achieving your career goals. Describe any leadership experiences and what you learnt from those experiences.</p>
                            <p>b) <strong>Work Experience :</strong> Be enthusiastic about your job experience. Portray yourself as one who tries to exceed expectations. Collective teamwork, inspiration, continuous learning and ownership. Be positive when talking about your boss or your firm. If you have changed jobs, it must show your motivation which leads to your desire for more challenges, more responsibilities, and the opportunity to grow and so on. Avoid negative comments like unappreciated, underpaid etc. Don’t be afraid to talk about a failure. Stress on what you learned from your failure. Describe your leadership experiences at work. Leadership potential is a very important quality desired by all MBA programs.</p>
                            <p>c) <strong>Goals :</strong> Show that you are committed to your career objectives. Your goals should be consistent with your experience and your desire to pursue further education. Be practical where you see yourself in five years ( refrain from making a statement like "I will be the CEO of Hewlett-Packard") and be prepared to demonstrate how advanced training and education will help you achieve your goals. Highlight some of the strengths of the program to further justify your choice. Make sure that all your answers are connected and reflect your thought for planning your future.</p>
                            <p>d) <strong>Personal :</strong> Be sure to prepare a brief outline of your dream. Take every opportunity to show that you are achievement oriented and strive to develop both personally and professionally. At the same time, show yourself to be a well-balanced and sensible person with varied interests. In your choice of books, it does not matter whether it is science fiction or biographies: the idea is to show yourself as knowledgeable in whatever interests you pursue.</p>
